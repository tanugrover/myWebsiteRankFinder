# myWebsiteRankFinder

This App provides the ranking of any website in leading Search Engines for a set of keywords.

I presently cover Google and Bing search engines.


Steps to Run:
1. Clean and Build (Libraries are already included)
2. Publish, may change port 


Upcoming:
1. Removal of libs. Dependencies listed in package.json can then be resolved using dotnet restore.
2. Clickable links in 'Reference Found' on Search Results page.

Any suggestions and improvements are welcome :)
